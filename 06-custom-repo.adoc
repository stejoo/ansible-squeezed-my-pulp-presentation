== Custom Repository

Let's host our own content!


=== How do I... ?

Road less traveled.

Documentation for the Pulp content plugins is available and contains examples (for `pulp-cli` and/or API).

Less so for `pulp.squeezer`... But the project's link:https://github.com/pulp/squeezer/tree/develop/tests/playbooks[tests/playbooks/] directory contains interesting code!

=== Build our own road

Using the nice modules provided by the collection.


=== Trials and tribulations

Not all operations required supported by `pulp.squeezer`.

Call the HTTP API.


=== Stay awhile and listen

About to enter... the Playbook zone.
