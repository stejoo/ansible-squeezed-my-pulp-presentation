== Updates

Progress, even better?

=== New release

`pulp.squeezer v0.0.14`

[%step]
* No `CHANGELOG`? See git log and changes
* adds `api_call` module, I can replace `get_url`
* depends on `pulp_glue` Python module (`>=0.19.0,<0.20.0`)
* `pulp_glue` only mentioned in `requirements.txt`

=== Contributing

I added a feature and was preparing a PR.

Release `v0.0.14` happened and I ran into some trouble (with `pulp_glue`).

Will rebase (soonâ„¢).
